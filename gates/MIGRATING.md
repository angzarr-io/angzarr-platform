# Changing the gates

These gates are a copy of angzarr-embedded's (`gates/`), which came from
the shared gates repository (`~/workspace/gates`) as taskloom's and
ctxloom-rs's copies did. They are angzarr-platform's own: change them here,
and nothing here reaches the other repositories, nor anything there this
one. Carry a fix across by hand when more than one needs it.

## A new hook needs `lefthook install`

lefthook installs a hook only for the hooks its config names when it is run,
and does not notice new ones in an `extends` file. After a change to
`gates/lefthook.yml` that names a hook not installed yet, each clone runs,
once:

```sh
lefthook install          # or: just hooks-install
```

## Red tests on branches

The gates allow a commit with failing tests on any branch but the default
one (warned `RED  tests: ... cannot merge into <default> until they pass`),
refuse it on the default branch, and keep red tests out of it with three
hooks: pre-merge-commit (a merge commit is tested as a commit is), pre-push
(a push to the remote's default branch runs the whole workspace's tests on
the pushed commit) and post-merge (a fast-forward of the default branch to
local work, which no hook can refuse, is tested just after and the way back
named). With a remote, record its default branch (`git remote set-head
origin --auto`): without origin/HEAD the default branch is the first of
init.defaultBranch, main and master that is a branch.
