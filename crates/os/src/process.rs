//! A child started as a TREE the caller can kill: the child and everything
//! it starts, however deep, in one call ([`Tree::kill_tree`]).
//!
//! A process group on unix (the child leads a new one; the kill is a
//! `killpg`), a job object on Windows (the child is assigned to a new one;
//! the kill is `TerminateJobObject`). Both are `process-wrap`'s, behind
//! this module, so a caller needs no `unsafe` and names no third-party
//! type.
//!
//! This module never reads the child's pipes: a descendant that outlives
//! the child and holds its stdout open does not delay [`Tree::wait`], and
//! the caller's own bounded read of the pipe is unaffected. The kill is
//! what ends such a descendant, and so closes the pipe.
//!
//! What a tree does not hold:
//!
//! - A descendant that leaves the tree escapes it: on unix, one that calls
//!   `setsid` or `setpgid`; on Windows, one created with
//!   `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` (a job allows that only if its limits do,
//!   and these do not forbid it). A kill reaches what stayed.
//! - Dropping a [`Tree`] does not kill it, as dropping a
//!   [`std::process::Child`] does not: a caller that is done with the tree
//!   kills it, or leaves it running on purpose.
//! - A new process group is not the terminal's foreground group, so a
//!   Ctrl-C at the terminal does not reach the tree. A caller that wants
//!   the tree to stop on Ctrl-C hears it itself ([`crate::Os::stop_signal`])
//!   and ends the tree ([`Tree::terminate_tree`], [`Tree::kill_tree`]).
//! - On unix a group's id is the leader's pid, and a kill signals that
//!   number. While any member lives (a zombie leader included) the number
//!   is not reused; a [`Tree`] kept after its whole group has gone and the
//!   leader been reaped could signal a group that has the number now. A
//!   caller ends a tree, then drops it.
